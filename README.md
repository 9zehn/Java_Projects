# Java Projects

A few Java projects I coded a while ago.

## Description
- Hashmap: Creates a simple hash map
- CommonWordFinder: parses through a text and, based on different data structures (linked list, hash map, BST, AVL tree), finds the most common word
- InversionCounter: sorting algorithm exercise, using mergesort
- Elementary_sorts: simple sorting exercise using elementary sorting algorithms
